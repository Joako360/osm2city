"Tile" might be a better name for what we now denote "cluster" in osm2city.
It was chosen however to avoid confusion with FG's scenery tiles.

A cluster is a collection of scenery objects (buildings, roads, etc), roughly
bounded by a rectangle. To speed up rendering, these objects will be merged 
into as few AC3D objects (drawables) as possible.
