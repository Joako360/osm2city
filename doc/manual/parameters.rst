Parameters [Builder]
####################

Please consider the following:

* Python does not recognize operating system environment variables, please use full paths in the parameters file (no ``$HOME`` etc).
* These parameters determine how scenery objects are generated offline as described in chapter :ref:`Scenery Generation <chapter-generation-label>`.
* All decimals need to be with "." — i.e. local specific decimal separators like "," are not accepted.
* Unless specified otherwise then all length is in metres and areas are in square metres.
* You do not have to specify all parameters in your ``params.py`` file. Actually it is better only to specify those parameters, which you want to actively control — the rest just gets the defaults.

The final truth about parameters is stored in ``parameters.py`` — unfortunately the content in this chapter of the manual might be out of date (including default values).

It might be easiest to read ``parameters.py`` directly. Python code is easy to read also for non-programmers. Otherwise you can run the following to see a listing:

::

    /usr/bin/python3 /home/vanosten/develop_vcs/osm2city/parameters.py -d

If you want to see a listing of the actual parameters used during scenery generation (i.e. a combination of the defaults with the overridden values in your ``params.py`` file, then you can run the following command:

::

    /usr/bin/python3 --file /home/pingu/development/osm2city/parameters.py -f LSZS/params.py

In order to reduce the total number of nodes of the buildings mesh and thereby reducing both disk space volume and rendering demands as well as to simplify the rendering of roofs, the geometry of buildings is simplified as follows:

* Only if not part of a building parent
* Only if no inner circles
* Only if a multiple of 4 nodes gets reduced and always 4 neighbouring points are removed at the same time (e.g. something that looks like a balcony from above, but can also point inwards into the building)
* If points get removed, which are also part of a neighbour building, then the simplification is not accepted.
* The tolerance of the below parameters is respected.

.. _chapter-parameters-buildings-level-height:

--------------------------
Building Levels and Height
--------------------------

In OSM the height of a building can be described using the following keys:

* ``building:height``
* ``roof:height``
* ``height`` (the total of building_height and roof_height, but most often used alone)
* ``building:levels``
* ``roof:levels`` (not used in osm2city)
* ``levels``

Most often none of these features are tagged and then the number of levels are determined based on the settlement type and the corresponding ``BUILDING_NUMBER_LEVELS_*`` parameter. The height is always calculated as the product of the number of levels times parameter ``BUILDING_LEVEL_HEIGHT_*``. If only the height is given, then the levels are calculated by simple rounding — and this level value is then used for calculating the height. The reason for this is that some uniformity in building heights/values is normally observed in the real world — and because the generic textures used have a defined height per level.

An exception to this is made for building parts in a relationship (`Simple 3D buildings`_), as the heights in this case might be necessary to be correct (e.g. a dome on a church).

There is some randomness about the number of levels within the same settlement type, which is determined by using a dictionary of level=ratio pairs, like:

::

    BUILDING_NUMBER_LEVELS_CENTRE = {4: 0.2, 5: 0.7, 6: 0.1}

meaning that there is a ratio 0f 0.2 for 4 levels, a ratio of 0.7 for 5 levels and a ratio of 0.1 for 6 levels. I.e. the keys are integers for the number of levels and the values are the ratio, where the sum of ratios must be 1.

Visibility Underground Buildings
--------------------------------

There seem to be challenges with consistency etc. in OSM in terms of deciding, whether something is under the ground and therefore ``osm2city`` should not render it.

According to findings in the `FG Forum <https://forum.flightgear.org/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=22809&start=1080#p347959>`_ and OSM there are different tags used, some of them better suited than others according to OSM documentation:

* ``location=underground`` or ``location=indoor`` seems to be a correct way (`key:location <https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:location>`_)
* ``indoor`` has also some usage (`key:indoor <https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:indoor>`_)
* ``tunnel`` is according to taginfo (`taginfo tunnel combinations <https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/keys/?key=tunnel#combinations>`_) used max 1000 times together with buildings
* ``level`` with negative values. NB: not to be confused with ``levels`` and ``building:levels`` (see chapter :ref:`Building Levels and Height <chapter-parameters-buildings-level-height>`)
* ``layer`` is not to be used to determine visibility (`key:layer <https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:layer>`_)

European Style Inner Cities (Experimental)
------------------------------------------


Given the available textures in ``osm2city-data`` and the in general limited tagging of buildings in OSM as of 201x, European cities look wrong, because there are too many modern facades used and too many flat roofs.

The following parameters try to "fix" this by adding OSM-tags ``roof:colour=red`` and ``roof:shape=gabled`` to all those buildings, which do not have parents or pseudo-parents (i.e. nor relationships or parts in OSM), but which share node references with other buildings. So typically what is happening in blocks in inner cities in Europe.

Roofs on Buildings

Below you will find quite a lot of parameters deciding what type of roofs should be generated on buildings. To understand the basic concepts, you should understand `OSM Simple 3D buildings`_. With ``complex roof`` below all those roof types, which are not flat/horizontal are meant.

The following parameters decide whether a complex roof should be used on top of a building at all.

Examples of overlap objects based on static objects at LSZS (light grey structures at bottom of buildings):

.. image:: lszs_hull_back.png


An example of difficult to handle situations is PHNL (Hawaii), where several objects inside the ac-file have rotations. The picture below shows the blocked areas (green) automatically detected. E.g. the large green area top left is a static object for the Admiral Bernard Chick Clarey Bridge. At the PHNL airport the green stripes parallel to the runway should actually be rather large areas covering most of the hangar areas of the airport.

.. image:: blocked_areas_phnl.png


The next image shows the blocked areas by parameter as well as the code to define these areas. There are at least two problems with this: (a) such issues cannot be detected automatically and (b) it is tedious and error prone to define these polygons. This is more a proof of concept and a "hack" for PHNL than anything else.

Remark in the parameters below that for roads only the bridge has been excluded - that is because it has been tested visually (again: tedious and slow).

Rectify Buildings
-----------------
Rectifies angles of corners in buildings to 90 degrees as far as possible (configurable). This operation works on existing buildings as mapped in OSM. It corrects human errors during mapping, when angles are not straight 90 degrees (which they are in reality for the major part of corners). I.e. there is no new information added, only existing information corrected.

This operation is mainly used for eye-candy and to allow easier 3-D visualization. It can be left out if you feel that the OSM mappers have done a good job / used good tooling. On the other hand the processing time compared to other operations is negligible.

The following picture shows an example of a rectified building with a more complex layout. The results are more difficult to predict the more corners there are. The red line is the original boundary, the green line the rectified boundary. Green circles are at corners, where the corner's angle is different from 90 degrees but within a configurable deviation (typically between 5 and 10 degrees). Corners shared with other buildings are not changed by the rectify algorithm (not shown here).

.. image:: rectify.png

Please note that if you are annoyed with angles in OSM, then you have to rectify them manually in OSM. One way to do that is to use :ref:`JOSM <chapter-josm-label>` and related plugins.

Generating Buildings Where OSM is Missing Buildings
---------------------------------------------------

It is possible to let ``osm2city`` generate buildings, where it is plausible that there in reality would be buildings, but buildings were not mapped in OSM. The following set of parameters make some customisation to specific areas possible. However parts of the processing is rather hard-coded (e.g. the available buildings are defined in code in module ``owbb/would_be_buildings.py`` in function ``_read_building_models_library()``. Still the results are much better than an empty scene.

No additional buildings are generated inside zones for aerodromes.

A lot of processing is dependent on land-use information (see e.g. :ref:`Land-use Handling <chapter-howto-land-use-label>` and :ref:`Land-use Parameters <chapter-parameters-landuse-label>`). For a short explanation of the process used see :ref:`Generate Would-Be Buildings <chapter-howto-generate-would-be-buildings-label>`.

In settlement areas an attempt is made to have the same terrace houses or apartment buildings along both sides of a way.

The first set of parameters determines the overall placement heuristics:

The second set of parameters determines the type of residential buildings to use and the distances between the buildings and the street as well as what happens in the backyard. The ``width`` of a building is along the street, the ``depth`` of a building is away from the street (front door to back door).

Land-Use
========

Land-use data is only used for built-up area in ``osm2city``. All other land-use is per the scenery in FlightGear. The main use of the land-use information processed is to determine building types, building height etc. for those buildings (often the majority), where this information is lacking and therefore must be obtained by means of heuristics. See :ref:`Land-use <chapter-howto-land-use-label>` for an overall description.

Complement OSM Land-Use Information
-----------------------------------

These operations complement land-use information from OSM based on some simple heuristics, where there currently are no land-use zones for built-up areas in OSM: If there are clusters of buildings outside of registered OSM land-use zones, then zones are added based on clusters of buildings and buffers around them. The land-use type is based on information of building types, amenities etc. — if available.

Generating Areas Where Roads are Lit

Land-use information is used to determine which roads are lit during the night (in addition to those roads which in OSM are explicitly tagged as
being lit).

The resulting built-up areas are also used for finding city and town areas — another reason why the values should be chosen conservative, i.e. large.

There might be situations, when you need to skip certain buildings or roads/railways, because e.g. the overlap checking does not work or the OSM features simply do not fit with the FlightGear scenery. Often it should be checked, whether the OSM data really is correct (if not, then please directly update the source in OSM) or the FlightGear scenery data is not correct (if not, then please check, whether source data can be improved, such that future versions of the scenery are more in line with reality and thereby with OSM data).

In order to temporarily exclude certain buildings or roads/railways, you can use parameter ``SKIP_LIST``. For buildings you can either specify the OSM id or (if available) the value of the ``name`` tag. For roads/railways only the OSM id can be used.

E.g. ``SKIP_LIST = ['St. Leodegar im Hof (Hofkirche)', 87220999]``

On the other hand side there might be situations, where certain STG-entries should not be checked for overlap checking. For that situation parameter ``SKIP_LIST_OVERLAP`` can be used as a list of ``*.ac`` or ``*.xml`` file names which should not be used for overlap tests

The boundary of a scenery as specified by the parameters boundary command line argument is not necessarily sharp. As described in :ref:`Getting OpenStreetMap Data <chapter-getting-data-label>` it is recommended to use ``completeWays=yes``, when manipulating/getting OSM data - this happens also to be the case when using the `OSM Extended API`_ to retrieve data. However there are no parameters to influence the processing of OSM nodes and OSM ways depending on whether they are inside / outside the boundary or intersecting.

The processing is as follows:

* buildings.py: if the first node is inside the boundary, then the whole building is processed — otherwise not
* roads.py: if not entirely inside then split at boundary, such that the first node is always inside and the last is either inside by default or the first node outside for splitting.
* piers.py: as above for piers
* platforms.py: as above for platforms
* pylons.py

  * storage tanks: if the centroid is inside the boundary, then the whole storage tank is processed — otherwise not
  * wind turbines and chimneys: no checking because the source data for OSM should already be extracted correctly
  * aerial ways: if the first node is inside the boundary, then the whole aerial way is processed — otherwise not (assuming that aerial ways are short)
  * power lines and railway overhead lines: as for roads. If the last node was split, then no shared model is placed assuming it is continued in another tile (i.e. optimized for batch processing across tiles)
